<h2>A Model of Crime and Social Interaction</h2> 
Originally by E.L. Glaeser, B.Sacerdote, and J.A. Scheinkman. <br><br>
Replicated by Brant Horio, George Mason University (2016)
</table>

<p>This model simulates a population of agents on a lattice, that explores how social interactions might explain high cross-city variance of crime rates.
<ul>
<li>Die-hard lawbreakers (dark orange-red) are not swayed by their neighbors and will always break the law.
<li>Die-hard law abiders (dark blue) are not swayed by their neighbors and will always abide by the law.
<li>Imitator agents randomly choose a neighbor (to the left or right) at each time step and copy their decision to break or abide by the law (light orange for imitating law breakers, light blue for imitating law abiders).
</ul>
